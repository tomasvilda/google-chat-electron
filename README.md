# Note

Since all other development has been discontinued, I created my own build. Only the mac build is maintained and tested.

### Installation notes for Mac
* For **Apple Silicon** macs download the **google-chat-electron-*-darwin-arm64.zip** file. For **all other macs** download **google-chat-electron-*-darwin-x64.zip** from the [releases folder](https://github.com/tomasvilda/google-chat-electron/releases).
* Extract the zip file and copy the "google-chat-electron" binary into the Application folder.
* On **Apple Silicon** macs run this command in a terminal window: 

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/google-chat-electron.app 
```
* Launch the Application and log into Google Chat

# Desktop app for Google Chat (old)

An unofficial desktop app for [Google Chat](http://chat.google.com) built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)

:mega: Since version 2.17, we have removed support for snap package on Linux

### Motivation

* Google has [shutdown](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/10194711) the official Google Chat Desktop App in March
  2021
* Google is forcing users to use PWA which has less features
* You don't want to install Chrome; just to use a PWA. :wink:

### Installation (Debian based Linux)

* You can download the latest debian installer from
  [releases](https://github.com/ankurk91/google-chat-electron/releases/latest) section
* Install the debian package with this command: (correct the file path yourself)

```bash
sudo apt install ~/path/to/google-chat-electron-xxx-amd64.deb
```

### Uninstall (Debian based Linux)

* Logout and Quit from app
* Remove the app with this command

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge google-chat-electron
```

* The uninstallation script should remove all relevant files and folders.

### Installation (Mac)

* Homebrew users can run

```bash
brew install --cask --no-quarantine google-chat-electron
```

or

* Download the zip (darwin) file from [releases](https://github.com/ankurk91/google-chat-electron/releases/latest)
* Extract the zip file
* Move the app to your `~/Applications` folder
* Fix the permission issue with this command

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Applications/google-chat-electron.app
```

* Above command should fix the Mac-OS Gatekeeper [issue](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/262355/)

### Uninstall (Mac)

* Logout and Quit from app
* Move the app to trash

### Installation Windows

* :warning: This app is **NOT** available
  on [Windows App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gchat-for-desktop/9MZXBPL66066)
* You can install this app by [downloading](https://github.com/ankurk91/google-chat-electron/releases/latest) the
  installer
* If you prefer [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows, you can run:

```powershell
choco install unofficial-google-chat-electron
```

* If you prefer [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) on Windows 10+, you can run:

```bash
winget install --id=ankurk91.GoogleChatElectron  -e
```

### Installation (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS)

We don't provide installers for Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, but you can build a local RPM package by your own.

```bash
sudo dnf install rpm-build npm
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
git clone https://github.com/tomasvilda/google-chat-electron.git
cd google-chat-electron

pnpm install
npm run pack:linux
npx electron-installer-redhat@^3 --src dist/google-chat-electron-linux-x64 --dest dist/installers/ --arch x86_64
```

This will create an RPM package in `./dist/installers` folder (you can specify any location you wish).
You can install it with `dnf` or `rpm-ostree` depending on your distro.

### Supported Platforms

The app should work on all x64 and Apple arm64 platforms, but due to lack of time; we test on most popular only.
